## HF Cubature

A Hartree Fock code that uses numerical cubature to compute the integrals, allowing for
arbitrary basis functions.

Experiments in vibe coding. This code has been written extensively by ChatGPT.


There needs to be extensive checking of convergence of the integrals with respect to the cubature
before any values can be considered reliable.

- [symbolic](symbolic) - Sympy scripts and other code for deriving and verifying values
- [scripts](scripts) - various utilities. Mostly convergence plotting.
